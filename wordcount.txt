Parallel processing is a method in computing of running two or more processors (CPUs) to handle separate parts of an overall task. ... These multi-core set-ups are similar to having multiple, separate processors installed in the same computer. Most computers may have anywhere from two-four cores; increasing up to 12 cores. Parallel processors are used for problems that are computationally intensive, that is, they require a very large number of computations. Parallel processing may be appropriate when the problem is very difficult to solve or when it is important to get the results very quickly. Multiprocessing A processing technique in which multiple processors or multiple processing cores in a single computer each work on a different job. Parallel processing A processing technique in which multiple processors or multiple processing cores in a single computer work together to complete one job more quickly. In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added for increasing computing power. While In Multithreading, many threads are created of a single process for increasing computing power. ... In Multiprocessing, Many processes are executed simultaneously. While in multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously. Both multithreading and multiprocessing allow Python code to run concurrently. Only multiprocessing will allow your code to be truly parallel. However, if your code is IO-heavy (like HTTP requests), then multithreading will still probably speed up your code. Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These parts are known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process. So multithreading leads to maximum utilization of the CPU by multitasking. The term Parallelism refers to techniques to make programs faster by performing several computations in parallel. This requires hardware with multiple processing units. In many cases the sub-computations are of the same structure, but this is not necessary. Graphic computations on a GPU are parallelism.
